# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction App  
A clean and modern medical application that predicts the risk of heart disease using a trained machine‑learning model. The project combines **Python**, **Tkinter**, **scikit‑learn**, and a polished UI design to create a complete, user‑friendly, and educational tool.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Machine learning model** trained on the Heart Disease dataset  
- **Modern Tkinter GUI** with a clinical, hospital‑inspired design  
- **13 medical input parameters** (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG data, etc.)  
- **Instant risk prediction** with clear visual feedback  
- **Modular architecture** separating UI, model, and logic  
- **Responsive and clean layout** focused on usability
